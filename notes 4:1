html info

margin- the distance of things outside the element
padding- the distance inside the element


clear: in css (do clear: both;) which recognizes floated things above and goes against it, if you do clear: both it only clears things floated left, same with right.

positions:
static- default

relative- allows you to specify top, right, bottom, and left and it will move it but it effects nothing else on the page. and moves however many px from its regular position

absolute- no longer apart of its normal flow and lock it in place.  locks every side to what you specify even if it breaks the height and width of the element. so to lock it to the bottom position: absolute, bottom: 0, left: 0, right: 0.relative to the nearest parent containter that has a position relative!!!

fixed- stuck there no matter what.


homework:
